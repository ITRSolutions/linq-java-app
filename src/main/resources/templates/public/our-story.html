        In 2014, Hussein Aladin and Mustafa Noorbhai founded LINQ
        Research LLC with a shared vision in mind: to shape the future of
        healthcare through a supportive, informative, and data-driven
        clinical research environment.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white mt-4 animate__animated animate__fadeInUp  w-100 m-auto">
        For over a decade, we've called Pearland, Texas our home, and
        we've grown significantly, now expanding rapidly across the
        greater Houston area. Over time our expertise has broadened
        to encompass a wide range of therapeutic areas, including
        internal medicine, vaccines, gastroenterology (GI),
        pulmonology, womenâ€™s health, and more.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white mt-4 animate__animated animate__fadeInUp  w-100 m-auto">
        Our research team consists of experienced clinical research
        site manager, clinical research coordinators, patient
        enrollment specialists, and regulatory experts who work
        collaboratively with sponsors and physicians to manage every
        aspect of clinical trials efficiently. Our principal Investigators
        (PI) and research team ensures the patient experience is at
        forefront and the integrity of the clinical trial data remains
        high.
